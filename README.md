# hx-lib

> A completing yet alternative standard library for Haxe.

## Compilation Flags

`-D LIB_DEBUG` which enables debug mode. Setting this flag will tell the `Throwable`s to include full Call- and ExceptionStack information. Though this can be helpful during development, it should not be enabled for production/releases as the operations are expensive.

`-D LIB_PERFORMANCE` which will disable runtime checks in `lib.io.Bit(s)` abstracts. This gives a little performance boost to the cost of safety.

`-D LIB_WIN` which will tell the library that we are compiling on a Windows system. This flag is used in `std.vm.Lock` class, as `SemaphoreSlim` doesn't work on non-Windows environments.

## Nullability

Haxe has a special type `Null<T>` which is mainly for documentation purpose and for static platforms (so e.g. `Int` can be `null`). You can find its typedef here: http://api.haxe.org/Null.html

Trying to follow the documentation aspect, all methods that accept a nullable value (e.g. `Null<Bytes>`) can safely be called with `null` - it is ensured they will _not_ throw an Exception or Error.

On the other hand, when a methods returns a value of type `Null<T>` that means, that the returned value may be `null`.
